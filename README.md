### Project Name: UART_32BITS_VHDL

### Description:
The UART_32BITS_VHDL project is an implementation of a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) in VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language), specifically designed for the Altera (now part of Intel) Cyclone II EP2C5T144C8 FPGA. The UART is a critical component in embedded systems that facilitates serial communication between devices via a point-to-point link.

This project provides an implementation of a UART supporting 32-bit data transmission. The UART includes transmission and reception modules, as well as a basic controller to handle serial communication.

### Features:
- Implementation of a UART in VHDL for transmission and reception of 32-bit data.
- Supports asynchronous serial communication between devices.
- Provides basic flow control to ensure reliable communication.
- Designed for the Altera (Intel) Cyclone II EP2C5T144C8 FPGA.
- Easily integrates into embedded systems and applications requiring serial communication.

### Technologies Used:
- VHDL
